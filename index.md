I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [Alverson Lab](https://alversonlab.com) in the [Department of Biological Sciences](https://fulbright.uark.edu/departments/biology/) at the University of Arkansas. I completed my doctoral work with Eric Roalson at Washington State University in the [School of Biological Sciences](https://sbs.wsu.edu) and the [Molecular Plant Sciences Graduate Program](https://mps.wsu.edu).

As a botanist and evolutionary biologist, I am fascinated by the enormous diversity of plant forms and flower morphology. Understanding diversification at the macro- and microevolutionary scales has long been a central goal of evolutionary biology. My research aims to understand the patterns and processes of diversfication. I combine bioinformatics, comparative genomics, phylogenetics, and developmental biology to investigate how underlying genetic networks and pathways have evolved to produce diverse phenotypes. I am particularly interested in the evolution of floral form in the genus _Achimenes_ (Gesneriaceae), a colorful and diverse genus native to Mexico and Central America.
