I am currently a graduate student in the [Roalson Lab](http://roalsonlab.weebly.com) at [Washington State University](http://www.wsu.edu) in the [School of Biological Sciences](http://www.sbs.wsu.edu) and the [Molecular Plant Sciences Graduate Program](http://www.mps.wsu.edu). Soon I will be a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Arkansas with Andrew Alverson, working on ecological and evolutionary genomics in diatoms.

As a botanist and evolutionary biologist, I am fascinated by the enormous diversity of plant forms and flower morphology. Understanding diversification at the macro- and microevolutionary scales has long been a central goal of evolutionary biology. My research aims to understand the patterns and processes of diversfication. I combine bioinformatics, comparative genomics, phylogenomics, and developmental biology to investigate how underlying genetic networks and pathways have evolved under natural selection to produce diverse phenotypes. I am particularly interested in the evolution of floral form in the genus _Achimenes_ (Gesneriaceae), a colorful and diverse genus native to Mexico and Central America.
