{% include section.html header="Comparative genomics in <em>Achimenes</em>" %}

Using comparative genomics in a phylogenetic and developmental context allows us to begin understanding how the molecular mechanisms underlying floral diversification. *Achimenes* is a small genus of 26 species native to Mexico that contains enormous variation in floral form that is closely tied to pollinator preferences. Flowers in _Achimenes_ are visited by bees, butterflies, euglossine bees, and hummingbirds, and represent distinct pollination syndromes. We have sequenced, assembled, and annotated the floral transcriptomes in 10 species of _Achimenes_ [(Roberts and Roalson 2017),(Roberts and Roalson, in Press)](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3623-8), representing species that display each pollination syndrome. Taking an evolutionary-developmental genetics perspective toward understanding diversification, each species was sampled using two or three time points during flower development in order to take advantage of inter- and intraspecies comparisons.

Gesneriaceae represent a large lineage (~3500 species) with an enormous amount of diversity, particularly in floral form. Constructing the largest dated phylogeny for gesneriads (nearly a quarter of species) and inferring divergence times has allowed us to test hypotheses related to the affect of geography, floral traits, epiphytism, and growth form on diversification [(Roalson and Roberts 2016)](http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/65/4/662). Broad-scale patterns of macroevolution can provide evidence for distinct patterns of evolution in different lineages.

In order to test the functional role of genes in planta, it is useful to have an efficient regeneration and transformation system. We have developed an successful micropropagation and *Agrobacterium*-mediated transformation for *Achimenes erecta* (Roberts et al., in prep). The ability to efficiently transform plant species with high successful will be useful to develop *Achimenes* into a model for evolutionary-developmental studies.
