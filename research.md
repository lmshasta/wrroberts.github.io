{% include section.html header="Comparative genomics in <em>Achimenes</em>" %}

Using comparative genomics in a phylogenetic and developmental context allows us to begin understanding how the molecular mechanisms underlying floral diversification. *Achimenes* is a small genus of 26 species native to Mexico that contains huge variation in floral form and pollination syndrome. We have already sequenced, assembled, and annotated floral transcriptomes for 4 species of *Achimenes* (*A. cettoana, A. erecta, A. misera, and A. patens*) across 3 developmental timepoints (Roberts and Roalson 2017, accepted). These provide valuable resources to perform inter- and intraspecies comparisons of gene sequence orthology, gene expression, and molecular evolution. Our sampling will soon be expanded to include an additional 6 species of *Achimenes* as well as 2 outgroup species. This will allow to test hypotheses related to the evolution of gene expression across species that share similar pollinators.

Gesneriaceae represent a large lineage (~3500 species) with an enormous amount of diversity, particularly in floral form. Constructing the largest dated phylogeny for gesneriads (nearly a quarter of species) and inferring divergence times has allowed us to test hypotheses related to the affect of geography, floral traits, epiphytism, and growth form on diversification [(Roalson and Roberts 2016)](http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/65/4/662). Broad-scale patterns of macroevolution can provide evidence for distinct patterns of evolution in different lineages.

In order to test the functional role of genes in planta, it is useful to have an efficient regeneration and transformation system. We have developed an successful micropropagation and *Agrobacterium*-mediated transformation for *Achimenes erecta* (Roberts et al., in prep). The ability to efficiently transform plant species with high successful will be useful to develop *Achimenes* into a model for evolutionary-developmental studies.
